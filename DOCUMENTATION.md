```python
# Old approach (deprecated)
employee = Employee.query.get(id)
project = Project.query.get_or_404(id)

# New approach
employee = db.session.get(Employee, id)

# With proper error handling for not found items
project = db.session.get(Project, id)
if not project:
    flash('Project not found.', 'danger')
    return redirect(url_for('projects')), 404
```

   - Uses pandas and openpyxl for generation
   - Preserves data types and formatting

2. **PDF**:
   - Printable reports with consistent layout
   - Includes title and proper column headers
   - Formatted for readability

3. **CSV**:
   - Simple, universal format for data exchange
   - Compatible with most data analysis tools
   - Useful for importing into other systems

The export system is built on reusable helper functions:

```python
def export_to_excel(data, prefix):
    """Helper function to export data to Excel"""
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    excel_file = io.BytesIO()
    df.to_excel(excel_file, index=False, engine='openpyxl')
    excel_file.seek(0)
    
    return send_file(
        excel_file,
        as_attachment=True,
        download_name=f'{prefix}_report.xlsx',
        mimetype='application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet'
    )
```

Each data type (Projects, Timesheets, Expenses, etc.) has its own dedicated export route:

```python
@app.route('/export/timesheets/<format>')
@login_required
def export_timesheets(format):
    """Export timesheets to Excel, PDF, or CSV"""
    timesheets = Timesheet.query.order_by(Timesheet.date.desc()).all()
    
    timesheets_data = []
    for timesheet in timesheets:
        employee = db.session.get(Employee, timesheet.employee_id)
        project = db.session.get(Project, timesheet.project_id)
        
        timesheets_data.append({
            'Date': timesheet.date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            'Employee': employee.name if employee else 'Unknown',
            'Project': project.name if project else 'Unknown',
            'Entry Time': timesheet.entry_time.strftime('%H:%M'),
            'Exit Time': timesheet.exit_time.strftime('%H:%M'),
            'Lunch (mins)': timesheet.lunch_duration_minutes or 0,
            'Raw Hours': f"{timesheet.raw_hours:.2f}",
            'Calculated Hours': f"{timesheet.calculated_hours:.2f}",
            'Labor Cost': f"${timesheet.calculated_hours * (employee.pay_rate if employee else 0):.2f}"
        })
    
    # Handle different format types
    if format == 'excel':
        return export_to_excel(timesheets_data, 'timesheets')
    elif format == 'pdf':
        return export_to_pdf(timesheets_data, 'Timesheets', 'timesheets.pdf')
    elif format == 'csv':
        return export_to_csv(timesheets_data, 'timesheets')
    else:
        flash('Invalid export format', 'error')
        return redirect(url_for('timesheets'))
```

The UI has been updated with dropdown menus for all export options:

```html
<div class="dropdown me-2">
    <button class="btn btn-outline-primary dropdown-toggle" type="button" id="exportDropdown" data-bs-toggle="dropdown" aria-expanded="false">
        Export
    </button>
    <ul class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="exportDropdown">
        <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="{{ url_for('export_projects', format='excel') }}">Excel (.xlsx)</a></li>
        <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="{{ url_for('export_projects', format='pdf') }}">PDF</a></li>
        <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="{{ url_for('export_projects', format='csv') }}">CSV</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```

### Enhanced Timesheet Calculations

The Timesheet model has been updated to implement precise lunch break rules:

```python
@property
def calculated_hours(self):
    """Calculate the actual working hours after deducting lunch break.
    Rules:
    - Lunch breaks ≥ 60 minutes: Only deduct 30 minutes
    - Lunch breaks < 30 minutes: No deduction
    - Lunch breaks 30-59 minutes: Deduct actual time
    """
    if self.lunch_duration_minutes is None:
        return self.raw_hours
    
    # Apply lunch deduction rules
    if self.lunch_duration_minutes >= 60:
        # For lunch breaks 1 hour or longer, deduct only 30 minutes
        return self.raw_hours - 0.5
    elif self.lunch_duration_minutes < 30:
        # For lunch breaks less than 30 minutes, no deduction
        return self.raw_hours
    else:
        # For lunch breaks between 30-59 minutes, deduct the actual time
        return self.raw_hours - (self.lunch_duration_minutes / 60.0)
```

This enhancement ensures fair and accurate calculation of employee working hours.

### Improved Payment Method Tracking

The PayrollPayment model has been enhanced to track detailed payment information:

```python
# New fields in PayrollPayment model
check_number = db.Column(db.String(50))  # Track check numbers for CHECK payments
bank_name = db.Column(db.String(100))    # Track bank information for CHECK payments

def validate_check_details(self):
    """Validate that check payments have a check number."""
    if self.payment_method == PaymentMethod.CHECK:
        return self.check_number is not None and self.check_number.strip() != ''
    return True
```

These additions allow tracking:
- Check numbers for check payments
- Bank names for better financial record-keeping
- Validation to ensure check payments have associated check numbers

### Enhanced Payroll Reporting

The payroll report functionality has been improved to:

1. **Display Payment Method Breakdowns**:
   - Separate sections for Cash and Check payments
   - Summary cards showing total amounts per payment method

2. **Improved Visualization**:
   - Color-coded indicators (green for Cash, blue for Check)
   - Check numbers displayed for Check payments
   - Comprehensive payment status tracking

3. **UI Optimizations**:
   - Properly sized numeric displays for large dollar amounts
   - Consistent spacing and alignment for financial data
   - Mobile-responsive design for field technicians

### Mock Data Generation

A dedicated script (`generate_mock_data.py`) has been implemented to generate realistic test data, including:

- 15 employees with various pay rates and skills
- 25 projects with different statuses and contract values
- 344 timesheets with various lunch break durations
- 96 materials with costs and categories
- 72 expenses with different payment methods
- 24 payroll payments (both Cash and Check methods)
- 3 invoices in various states

This data is crucial for stress testing and validating the system's performance with realistic volumes.

### Database Schema Updates

Added script (`update_schema.py`) to upgrade existing databases with the new payment tracking fields:

```python
# Adding new columns to payroll_payment table
conn.execute(sa.text('ALTER TABLE payroll_payment ADD COLUMN check_number VARCHAR(50)'))
conn.execute(sa.text('ALTER TABLE payroll_payment ADD COLUMN bank_name VARCHAR(100)'))
```

### UI Improvements

Enhanced the display of large financial values throughout the application:

- Changed from `display-4` to `display-6` class for dashboard cards
- Replaced `h2` with `h3` elements for payment summary cards
- Added consistent margin and padding for financial data
